## About The Project

A Simple C program that takes user inputs of the orders and computes the total amount due.

The user has the option to enter one main, one side, and one drink of their choice or opt to avail the Meal Set of the Day, which is randomly generated by the program. By choosing the Meal Set of the Day, the user will receive a 15% discount on the selected set, and the set changes with each program execution.

## Features
- **Ordering** 
	- A user can order up to three meals at once, with each meal being limited to one item per main, side and drink
- **Cancelling** 
	- A user has the option to cancel the current meal or all meals during the end of every order.
- **Modifying** 
	- A user is given the option to modify a meal after all the items have been ordered.
